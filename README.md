# Parallax wallpaper plugin

<!-- TODO: insert some nice images/videos of the plugin's functionality -->

This is a wallpaper plugin for Plasma 5 which allows its users to "stretch" an image between multiple virtual desktops, so that moving between those desktops shows different portions of the background. It ties very well with the "Slide" Virtual Desktop animation when it is set to not slide the desktop background.
