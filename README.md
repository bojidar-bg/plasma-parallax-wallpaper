This is a wallpaper plugin for Plasma 6 which allows its users to "stretch" an image between virtual desktops, so that moving between the desktops shows different portions of the background.

*Note:* If using the Slide animation between virtual desktops, make sure that <kbd>System Settings</kbd> / <kbd>Window Management</kbd> / <kbd>Virtual Desktops</kbd> / <kbd>("Slide" animation configuration)</kbd> / <kbd>Slide desktop background</kbd> is off.

**Settings:**
* **Parallax Zoom Factor:** How much to zoom into the image. At 100%, parallax can be observed only on the side of the image that is longer than the screen. At higher values, parallax can be observed in both directions.
* **Parallax Crop Factor:** How much of the image to crop. At 100%, makes sure that parallax on X and parallax on Y moves the background by the same amount. At 0%, makes sure that all parts of the image are visible on some virtual desktop.
* **Slide Duration:** How long the slide animation should be.
